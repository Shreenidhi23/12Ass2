#Write a program to compare two numbers are
1.equal.
2.Not equal.
3.one num is greater than another one.
4.one num is smaller than another one.

num1=int(input("Number 1 : "))
num2=int(input("Number 2 : "))
if num1>num2:
    print("Number1 is greater than Number2")
elif num1<num2:
    print("Number1 is less than Number2")
elif num1!=num2: 
    print("Number1 is equal to Number2")
 
else: 
    print("Number1 is not equal to number2")
    o/p:
    Number 1 : 55
Number 2 : 45
Number1 is greater than Number2
